git branch NAME_BRANCH or git checkout -b NAME_BRANCH
fast fowrward is when git can tell when the commmits happened and put one set of commits on top of another. Recursive is when commits are not in order and/or in different branches 
git checkout 
git branch -d NAME_BRANCH or -D to force 
When same files are made and modified on seperate branches then merged 


Part 2 

1. git checkout -b first_merge 
touch branching_exercise.txt
git add .
git commit -m "branching steps exs"
git checkout master 
git merge first_merge  

2. git checkout -b second_merge 
touch branching_exercise.txt (edit differently)
git add .
git commit -m "new modified file"
git checkout first_merge 
git merge second_merge
